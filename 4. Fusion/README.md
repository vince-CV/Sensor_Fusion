# Fusion: Kalman Filters

- Fuse data from multiple sources using Kalman filters. 
- Merge data together using the prediction-update cycle of Kalman filters, which accurately track object moving along straight lines. 
- Build extended and unscented Kalman filters for tracking nonlinear movement.

## Project: Unscented Kalman Filter Highway Project
Code an Unscented Kalman Filter in C++ to track highly non-linear pedestrian and bicycle motion.

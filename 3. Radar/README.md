# Radar

- Analyze radar signatures to detect and track objects. 
- Calculate velocity and orientation by correcting for radial velocity distortions, noise, and occlusions. 
- Apply thresholds to identify and eliminate false positives.
- Filter data to track moving objects over time.

## Project: Radar Target Generation And Detection
Calibrate, threshold, and filter radar data to detect obstacles in real radar data.

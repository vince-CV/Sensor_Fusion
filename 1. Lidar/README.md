# Lidar

- Process raw lidar data with filtering, segmentation, and clustering to detect other vehicles on the road. 
- Implementation Ransac with planar model fitting to segment point clouds. 
- Implementation Euclidean clustering with a KD-Tree to cluster and distinguish vehicles and obstacles.


## Project: Lidar Obstacle Detection
Detect other cars on the road using raw lidar data from real self-driving car, Carla. Implement custom RANSAC and euclidean clustering algorithms.


### Point Cloud Filtering
- Voxel Grid:
Voxel grid filtering will create a cubic grid and will filter the cloud by only leaving a single point per voxel cube.
- Region of Interest:
A boxed region is defined and any points outside that box are removed.

### Point Cloud Segmentation
Planar model to segment point cloud data using **RANSAC**.

Ransac, Random Sample Consensus, and is a method for detecting outliers in data.
- each iteration randomly picks subset of points
- fit a model to the points
- iteration with the most inliers to the model is best

### Point Cloud Clustering
Perform **Euclidean clustering**, and build **KD-Tree** to do efficient **nearest neighbor search** for clustering.

Euclidean Clustering, based on nearest neighbor search. KD-Tree KD-Tree speeds up look up time from O(n) to O(log(n)) (tree allows you to better break up your search space.) By grouping points into regions in a KD-Tree, it can avoid calculating distance for possibly thousands of points just because they are not considered in a close enough region. 

KD-Treeï¼š organize data spatially, and is a binary tree that splits points between alternating axes. 

Having a balanced tree that evenly splits regions improves the search time for finding points later. To improve the tree, insert points that alternate between splitting the x region and the y region evenly.
